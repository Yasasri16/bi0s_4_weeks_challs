When I ran the file "embryogdb_level3" using "gdb ./embryogdb_level3" , I got the level description.. We were asked to figure out the random value on the stack.. To do that, we must find out at where the random value is being set.. So we keep using ni and find where the random value is being set.. Then we have to break at that address.. The rsp values changes before the break point and after the break point.. So we print the rsp values using "x/4gx $rsp" at the beginning and then use "c" to go through the program.. Then after the random value got set up, print the rsp values again.. There will be change in one of those values and hence that's the random value.. Then we use "c" then it asks for random value.. We paste it and the flag displays..
