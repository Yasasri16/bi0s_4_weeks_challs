When I ran the file "embryogdb_level1" using "gdb ./embryogdb_level1" , I got the description of the level.. In this level, we need to find the current random value of register r12 in hex.. So I used the command "p/x $r12" .. it gave me the random value.. Then I used "c" to continue through the program.. Then it asked me for the random value and I pasted it.. Boom.. The flag displayed..
