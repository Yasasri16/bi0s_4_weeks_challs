To execute the file :



I solved this in 2 ways.

Script 1 :

We should first check where the random value is being set. Then we should set a breakpoint there.

Here it is main+721. After setting the breakpoint, we used "commands" and wrote some code in it. 

This code gets executed whenever the breakpoint is hit. Here, whenever the breakpoint is hit, I printed the random values in the stack. 

As ik where the random value is, I will copy it and paste it when it asks us for the random value.

Since there is a series of random values, we need to enter them again and again. (kinda long)
