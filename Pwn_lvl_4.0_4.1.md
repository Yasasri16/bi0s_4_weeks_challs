I got the code.. It takes some input and stores it in a var "buf".. It prints our initial input in hexa decimal format.. Then it says our data got mangled.. The logic behind the mangling is that the characters get sorted in ascending order.. If input is "acb" , it will be modified to "abc".. If modfied input matches with expected output, it will print the flag..

Same with level 4.1
