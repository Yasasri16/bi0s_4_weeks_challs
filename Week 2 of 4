-Completed Gojo's Reversal Cursed Technique :
So, A file was given to us.. I saw that it is a binary file and used ghidra to decompile it.. It then gave me a 500 line program in C.. I started reading the code day by day and finally came to understand it.. Every program starts getting executed from the main..So I saw the functions in the main and started removing some unnecessary functions from the code.. The code became a bit shorter.. So the program first takes any random input and stores it in acStack_519 from the first index.. Then it becomes 2 different strings after we do some transformations on them.. For the first thing, which is __s,we get it after we apply the scar,key_e,tomato,scar etc etc 10 times.. Cuz the function which generates __s iterates 10 times and each time, one of the three function gets called and out input keeps changing and changing and after 10 iterations, we get a new string which is __s..Similarly we get _s_00 by applying key_e,tomato and scar so on for 13 times..Cuz the function which genereates this iterates 13 times.. Scar function operators XOR on each character and give a new character back.. Key_e just takes the ascii values of all characters and concats them.. Tomato is actually written to do rot13.. But since key_e is operating before tomato, we get numbers as input for tomato.. So there won't be any change in the string.. After we get s and s00, now another string s2 gets generated by taking one char from s and another from s00 alternatively and enclosed by #.. So i wrote a python script for dng these transformations.. Then I ran this file.. It asked me for a random input.. I gave "go".. Then it asked me for ouput after ur input undergoes all these transformations.. If my input now and s2 matches, the program will display the flagg.. It did..
