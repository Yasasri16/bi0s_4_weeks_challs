I got the code.. It takes some input and stores it in a var "buf".. It prints our initial input in hexa decimal format.. Then it says our data got mangled.. The logic behind the mangling is that the string will get reversed.. After reversing, it will compare our modified input with the expected output and will print the flag..

Level 3.1 is same as this..
